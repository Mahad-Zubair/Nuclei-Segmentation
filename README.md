## Introduction
Nuclei segmentation is a crucial task in various biomedical applications, such as cell counting, tissue analysis, and cancer diagnosis. The U-Net model, with its encoder-decoder architecture and skip connections, has proven to be effective in segmenting nuclei from microscopic images.

This project demonstrates how to implement and train a U-Net model using Python and TensorFlow. The code includes data loading, preprocessing, model definition, training, and evaluation.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow 2.x
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-image

You can install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install tensorflow opencv-python numpy matplotlib scikit-image
```

## Dataset
The Pannuke dataset is used for training and testing the model. It consists of images and corresponding masks for nuclei segmentation.
Code Structure
Data Loading: Images and masks are loaded from specified directories.
Data Preprocessing: Images and masks are resized and prepared for training.
Model Building: U-Net architecture is implemented for semantic segmentation.
Model Training: The model is compiled and trained on the training data.
Model Evaluation: Training progress and model performance are monitored.
Instructions
Ensure the Pannuke dataset is correctly set up in the specified directories.
Run the provided code to load data, build the U-Net model, and train the model.
Monitor training progress using TensorBoard logs.
Checkpoint the best model during training for future use.ontain the original microscopic images, and the `masks` directory should contain the corresponding segmentation masks.

## Usage

### Data Preparation
The code includes functions to load and preprocess the data. The `load_data()` function reads the images and masks from the specified directories and resizes them to a fixed size. The `plot_random_images_masks()` function plots random images and their corresponding masks for visualization.

### Model Training
The U-Net model is defined using TensorFlow's Keras API. The model is compiled with the Adam optimizer and binary cross-entropy loss. The training process is controlled by callbacks for early stopping and TensorBoard logging.

To train the model, run the following code:

```python
results = model.fit(X_train, Y_train, validation_split=0.1, batch_size=16, epochs=100, callbacks=callbacks)
```

This will train the model for 100 epochs with a validation split of 10% and a batch size of 16.

### Inference
After training the model, you can use it for inference on new images. The code includes a section for loading test images and performing inference.

## Results
The trained U-Net model should be able to accurately segment nuclei from microscopic images. The results can be evaluated using various metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
